1. Change adventure.py line 37 raw_input('> ') to input('> ')
2. Packages, modules, classes, and functions
3. Bad names: in adventure.py line 19, the function "loop()" is a bad name since it doesn't tell us what kind of loop it is and what it does. 
In data.py, functions that are named from section1 to section12 are not meaningful names. It is hard to tell what they do out of context.
Good name: in game.py line 822, "write_default_message" is a descriptive name.
4. In adventure.py line 19, the function "loop()" doesn't just do one thing. In data.py line 54, the function accumulate_message(dictionary) only does one thing. In data.py line 34, “referent(self, word)” only check if word.kind == 'noun’.
5. In data.py line 107, the function "section4(data, n, text, *ect)" changes the argument
"text" to lower case, and it modifies the original argument by changing into lower case and long_words.
In game.py line 772, the function die(self) modifies the instance variables "deaths" and "is_dead".
In model.py, line 130 functions "carry(self)", line 134 "drop(self)", and line 138 "hide(self)" all have side effects.
6. There is no significant duplicated code. In game.py, there are long functions, such as function move_dwaeves(line 188) and dispatch_command(line 501) that can be broken down to smaller functions. But I do find part of two functions that are duplicated. In game.py, the function t_throw(line 1239) and t_drop(line 896) both have the following duplicated code:
if not obj.is_toting:
    self.write(verb.default_message)
    self.finish_turn()
    return
This could be easily made into its own function. For instance:
def write_verb_message_and_end_turn_if_object_not_toting(self, obj, verb)
  if not obj.is_toting:
      self.write(verb.default_message)
      self.finish_turn()
      return
7. Yes. In adventure.py, we have exception in the loop function:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        loop()
    except EOFError:
        pass
When you enter control+c, it gives you exception.
8. In game.py, the class Game(object) has more than one functionality. It handles
movement logic, game starting and ending, logic for objects interaction and more.
9. Not all classes are not cohesive. For example, in model.py, class Room(object), Word(object), Hint(object), and Pirate(Dwarf) are not cohesive.
10. The author comments on particular lines that they think might be confusing
to explain what they are doing. They also give classificatory comments for some
functions.
Good example: adventure.py line 13 to 17
def baudout(s):
    for c in s:
        sleep(9. / BAUD)  # 8 bits + 1 stop bit @ the given baud rate
        stdout.write(c)
        stdout.flush()
Bad example:
game.py line 1303  def i_quit(self, verb):  #8180
game.py line 1310  def t_find(self, verb, obj):  #9190
All the numerical comments are unclear and they do not explain what the function does.
There are more comments in game.py that are just numbers, which do not offer any
explanation for the code.
11. In adventure.py, line 19 the function "loop()" has nice vertical formatting. It leaves
a line between each segment of code.
12. Yes, the test passes after making change in adventure.py line 37 raw_input('> ') to input('> ‘). The test meets the F.I.R.S.T criteria. The tests are fast since they only 
take a minuscule amount of time to run. They are independent since no tests rely on state 
or results created by other tests. They are repeatable since they produce the same results 
every time they are run against the same code and do not rely on any previous state. They 
are self-verifying since they explicitly return whether or not they were successful and 
require no interpretation to tell whether they failed or not. Assuming that the tests were written during production rather than after, there are also timely.
